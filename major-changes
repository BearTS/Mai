Changes from Mai v2.4.0 -> Mai v3.0.0

You can still view the previous version here ---> https://github.com/maisans-maid/Mai/tree/2.4.0

• Major Script rewrite
The structure of the code in this new version is totally different from the previous version. Using codes from here
together with the code from v2.4.0 is not possible.

• Removed Commands
Temporarily removed all of music and all of currency command. Ideas for currency are currently scarce and I can't think of ways to
make use of it (games, daily, etc doesn't work it doesn't make sense you only get to earn currency but no way to spend it).
As for music, bot currently cannot support music feature as the hosting is free. The code is already available (didn't pushed
to repo yet) and will be pushed to the master branch as soon as the bot is hosted on a dedicated hosting services.

• Reworked Commands
    • invite ------ now generates links for Mai, support server, and an advertised server
    • ping   ------ new visuals
    • stats  ------ new visuals
    • rank   ------ not exactly new but still new visuals

    anisched commands
      removed the subcommand methods, changed command names
      • [anisched add] is now [watch]
      • [anisched remove] is now [unwatch]
      • [anisched list] is now [watching]
      • [anisched setchannel] is now [setanischedch]
      • [channel, clean, help, next] are removed entirely

    ps commands
      removed currency commands, removed subcommands for xp commands, changed some command names
      • [ps xptoggle] is now [xptoggle]
      • [ps xpallow] is now [xpenable]
      • [ps xpexcempt] is now [xpexcempt]
      • [ps xpreset] is now [xpreset]
      • [help] subcommand is removed in favor of main [help] command

• Added new commands
Updating to a higher version only to remove commands doesn't make any sense. Though most of these commands are supposed to be
pushed with the previous version if not for the errors that i couldn't fix before. They're here now, idk if it's even used tho

    This version is still experimental and will be executed for a week for debugging, ---> if no more errors are reported at the end
    of  the week, this version will officially be used, will change the README.md file for consistency within a month, and will
    edit the webpage. If experiment fails (bot cannot work properly, always crashes), will roll back to the previous version (v2.4.0)
    and will fix the errors.

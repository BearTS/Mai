### Why should you invite Mai?
Mai is a simple yet powerful Discord Bot that aims to give discord users an enhanced "Discord Experience". Mai provides a variety of fun and informative commands that you can use with your friends.

Mai can:
- Spice up chat environment with the use of roleplay/action commands such as pat, hug, slap, and more! </font> <br />
-  Search through the internet for information resources through various functions such as anime information lookup (series, characters, and even seiyuus!), games (via steam), or even time on some cities. </font> <br />
-  Ease the work of moderators by managing the server through various single commands. </font> <br />
-  Provide Airing Information automagically, implement user experience system, as well as server-based economy system. </font> <br />
-  Acquire totally random fun facts from various sources Mai has access to. </font> <br />


### Invite
You may invite Mai through https://invite.mai-san.ml.

### Support
If you have questions regarding the bot and it's use, please do join our support server at https://support.mai-san.ml/.

### Contribute
Contribution includes, but is not limited to making a Pull Request. For reference, I have been struggling on proper implementation of the economy command. I am expecting that most contributors will probably be coming from there.

Pull Requests regarding totally new commands without foretelling the developer via creating issue will automatically be rejected.

If you love this work and wish to contribute in another manner, please do join our support server (which isn't much) and ping/mention **Sakurajimai#6742** there.

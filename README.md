### üì¢ Rewrite Coming Soon
Rewrite for Mai that will be written on the freshly released [v13](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/releases/tag/13.1.0) of djs is just around the corner. Be wary that the newer release [v5-Public] may have less features than the current version of the bot [v4]. This might include discontinued support for sharding and music, and the removal of message based command entirely to fully utilize the slash command feature specifically made for bots.

### üì¢ Migration from Public to Private
This repository will be updated with the code for the rewritten bot following the __official__ version 13 release of discord.js, once both the library and the updated bot have been deemed stable. Our hosted version of the bot, [__Mai__](https://mai.gg/) **does not run the code in this repository**. The official bot's source code has been made private and moved to a [Github Organization](https://github.com/mai-bot/). We will still maintain this repository over time with patches and slowly release new features once they have been tested throughly to ensure they are of the utmost quality. We will only be providing limited, non-obligatory support to self-hosting users **who have not made changes to the code we deem to be significant**.
